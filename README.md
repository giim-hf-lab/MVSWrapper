# Inference Engine in C++

The project is written in C++20 (without the new module system) and is intended to be used as a framework in the future.

In the current status, however, the CMakeLists.txt is just for experimental use, and it doesn't actually meet the requirements to build the artifacts as a valid CMake target, nor does it compile to any shared or static libraries. The compilation output is more like demos of how this framework should be used.
